4. Press right-mouse button on the Current Repository
5. Click "Show in Explorer" to explore the Local Files.

![Github Desktop ...](/Github/23_Explore.png)

This is your Local Github Repository.  It will always have a hidden folder named `.git` with information about the Repository.  You don't need to be able to see this folder, as we are not going to do anything with it manually.  There are also files called `ReadMe.md`, `.GitIgnore` and `.GitAttribute`, we can ignore the `.GitAttribute` file and only look at the `ReadMe.md` and `.GitIgnore` files.

![Github Desktop ...](/Github/24_LocalFiles.png)

6. Open the `ReadMe.md` File in any text editor.  Here we can change the description and README of the project.  See [this Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for formatting syntax

![Github Desktop ...](/Github/25_ReadMe.png)

7. Open the `.GitIgnore` in any text editor.  Here we can tell Github which files to ignore when uploading the project.  Think personal configuration or files containing sensitive information.

![Github Desktop ...](/Github/26_GitIgnore.png)

> Submitting your first commit
1. Lets head back to the Github Desktop application

![Github Desktop ...](/Github/30_RepoList.png)
